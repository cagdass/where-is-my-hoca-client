#Where is my Hoca? Client

Front-end application in React for **Where is my Hoca?**

Since there is not anywhere else that the data is explicitly available, I wrote my own application to:

* Find the weekly schedules of Bilkent professors.
* Find the weekly schedules of classrooms filter by building. 
* Query the empty classrooms at a given time, filter by building.
* Query courses that can be taken during given free hours and filter by department.

Feel free to suggest/contribute:

## Future work
* Searching a course by its course title.

You can find the application deployed at [http://cgds.me/whereismyhoca](http://cgds.me/whereismyhoca)

There is a back-end application running at http://cgds.me:3000, you can find the code to that application [here](http://github.com/cagdass/where-is-my-hoca-server).
