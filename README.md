#Where is my Hoca? React

Front-end application in React for **Where is my Hoca?**

Since there is not anywhere else the data is explicitly put, I wrote my own application to:

* Find the weekly schedules of Bilkent professors.
* Find the weekly schedules of classrooms. 
* **Implemented, *design not complete*:** Query the empty classrooms at a given time.

You can find the application deployed at [http://cgds.me/whereismyhoca](http://cgds.me/whereismyhoca)

There is a back-end application running at http://cgds.me:3000, you can find the code to that application [here](http://github.com/cagdass/where-is-my-hoca-server).
